Authentication framework using Backbone.js and Twitter Bootstrap

**************

Based on a few apps I've written which use Backbone.js in the login
process.  This is a work-in-progress to create a framework for simple
authentication using a Backbone 'session' model, as I've found a
lack of examples and documentation around this area.

Feel free to message me with questions.
